# Face-Detection
It is used to find and identify human faces in images.

## Objective
This project will introduce you to the concept of object detection in Python using the OpenCV library and how you can utilize it to perform tasks like Facial detection.

### Pre-requisites
Hands-on knowledge of Numpy and Matplotlib is essential before working on the concepts of OpenCV. Make sure that you have the following packages installed and running before installing OpenCV.

->cv2: It stands for OpenCV, which is an open-source computer vision library. OpenCV is widely used for image and video processing tasks. The code utilizes OpenCV for 
          image-related operations.
          
->Numpy:It is a library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical              functions to operate on these arrays.

->Matplotlib: It is a plotting library in Python that provides a wide variety of visualization tools and functions. In this code, matplotlib is used for displaying the 
               images.

->The line "%matplotlib inline" is a Jupyter Notebook-specific command that allows the generated plots or images to be displayed directly in the notebook interface.



#### Installation
cv2:Install OpenCV using the command 'pip install opencv-python'.

numpy: Install numpy using the command 'pip install numpy'.

matplotlib:Install matplotlib using the command 'pip install matplotlib'.
